Shift events by 1 video frame to account for bitssharp delay. 

Currently using extra columns of the trl structure and trialinfo to encode important
information. Figure out the best way to move from using trialinfo to fields that are more clear


Make the steadystate structure use a uniform naming scheme.  Currently it has 
a mix of fieldtrip names and powerdiva names (Axx struct).  This makes using some of the previous
code simpler but makes the data structure confusing. 

Add in using the sessionInfo data from ptbCorgi to get accurate stimulus information

Check resample code to see if samples are being calculated in the best way.
The photodiode has a bit of out of frequency energy. But it has a very high
slew rate so might not be possible to get 100% without a hardware sample clock lock.
